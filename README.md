# Overview

#### Description
I built a calculator program with the python language. This program allows an user to input a number and subsequently add, subtract, multiply, divide, or find the average of that number and any other number they decide to input.

#### Purpose for writing this software
I wrote this program to refresh my coding skills, as it has been some time since I have programmed with an object-oriented focus, and the main reason I wrote this code was to learn the correct syntax and ins and outs of how the language of python itself works.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
The tools I used to develop this software was obviously Visual studio code and many online forums including W3Schools, StackOverflow, and python Wikipedia. I also read an article at hackr.io for some inspiration on which project would be appropriate to write to develop my python skills

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used the programming language of python, specifically version 3.8.8 64-bit.

# Future Work

* I need to fix the fact that the user is unable to use a running total for this program and it can only execute one function (addition, division) at a time
* I think adding a couple more advanced functions such as squaring, square-root and a logarithm function would be beneficial
